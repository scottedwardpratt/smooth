\section{Performing Full Model Runs}\label{sec:fullmodel}

\subsection{Overview}

After setting the locations of the training points in model-parameter space, as described in Sec. \ref{sec:tpo}, it is the responsibility of the User to run the full model at those points and record the values of all the observables for each point. Only then can the {\it Smooth Emulator} software proceed to the next step of tuning the emulator. Training data for a run generated from a specific point in model-parameter space is stored in a unique directory. 

\subsection{Format for Training Data}

Once the training points are generated, the User must run the full model for each of the training points. At this point there is a directory, {\tt \$\{MY\_ANALYSIS\}/smooth\_data/FullModelRuns/}, in which there are sub directories, {\tt run0/, run1/, run2/...}.  Within each sub-directory, {\tt runI}, there should exist a text file {\tt smooth\_data/FullModelRuns/runI/model\_parameters.txt}, where $I=0,1,2,\cdots$. These files could have been generated by {\tt trainingpoint\_optimizer}, but could have been generated by any other means, including by hand. The files should be of the form,
\vspace*{-8pt}{\tt \begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
parameter_name_1  x1
parameter_name_2  x2
parameter_name_3  x3
.
\end{Verbatim}
}\vspace*{-8pt}
The model-parameter names must match those defined in \\{\tt \$\{MY\_ANALYSIS\}/smooth\_data/Info/prior\_info.txt}, the format of which is described in Sec. \ref{sec:tpo}. 

The User must then perform full model runs using the model-parameter values as defined in each sub-directory. The full model runs should write a list of observable values in each run directory in files named {\tt smooth\_data/FullModelRuns/runI/obs.txt}, where $I=0,1,2,\cdots$. The format of those text files should be
\vspace*{-8pt}{\tt \begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
observable_name_1  Y1  
observable_name_2  Y2  
observable_name_3  Y3  
.
\end{Verbatim}
}\vspace*{-8pt}
The names must match those listed in {\tt smooth\_data/Info/observable\_info.txt}, as described in Sec. \ref{sec:emulator}. The observable values are calculated by the full model for the model-parameter values listed in the corresponding {\tt model\_parameters.txt} file in the same directory.

Once the observable files are produced for each of the full model runs, the User can then proceed to build and tune an emulator using {\it Smooth Emulator}.
