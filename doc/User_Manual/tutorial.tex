\section{Template-Based Tutorial}\label{sec:tutorial}

Here, using a fake model, and beginning from a template, we guide the User into generating the training points with Simplex Sampler, running the fakemodel to provide the observables at the training points, then tuning the emulator. The expected output from this procedure is detailed below. The procedure is outlined both with and without the PCA reduction of the observable space.

First, it is assumed that the User has downloaded and installed the software as described in Sec. \ref{sec:installation}.
